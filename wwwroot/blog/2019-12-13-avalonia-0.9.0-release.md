We are pleased to announce that [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) 0.9.0 has been
released.

0.9 is a huge update, it has been extensively tested and brings some great new features and improvements.


# Compiled XAML
In previous releases XAML was parsed at runtime. had a non-significant runtime overhead and that some errors could cause runtime crashes.

For 0.9 we have built a XAML compiler that parses XAML at build time, and compiles it to MSIL.

This greatly improves runtime performance, application startup times and allows errors to be caught at build time instead of runtime.

The new XAML compiler also allows the debugger to step into XAML code.

# OSX / Linux Native Menus
OSX places a menu that is permanently at the top of the screen. The first item of which the title matches the application name, it is a global application menu, and is displayed regardless of the selected window or if the application is minimised.

For applications feel like they belong on OSX they need to implement these menus. The same applies to some window managers on Linux, although it is less common.

Avalonia will now create this menu for you, and generate the standard menu items that OSX users expect.

If you want to customise this menu, then you can do so by declaring a Native Menu in your Application.xaml file like so.

```xml
<Application>
  <NativeMenu.Menu>
    <NativeMenu>
      <NativeMenuItem Header="About MyApp" Command="{Binding AboutCommand}" />
    </NativeMenu>
  </NativeMenu.Menu>
</Application>
```

The consequence of this is that the Application class now has a DataContext property, where you can assign a ViewModel and bind to properties, just like any other control in Avalonia.

The Window menus of course are window specific, and can be declared like:

```xml
<NativeMenu.Menu>
    <NativeMenu>
      <NativeMenuItem Header="File">
        <NativeMenuItem.Menu>
          <NativeMenu>
            <NativeMenuItem Header="Open" Command="{Binding OpenCommand}"/>
            <NativeMenuItemSeperator/>
            <NativeMenuItem Header="Recent">
              <NativeMenuItem.Menu>
                <NativeMenu/>
              </NativeMenuItem.Menu>
            </NativeMenuItem>
            <NativeMenuItemSeperator/>
            <NativeMenuItem Header="Quit Avalonia" Command="{Binding CloseCommand}" Gesture="CMD+Q"/>
          </NativeMenu>
        </NativeMenuItem.Menu>
      </NativeMenuItem>
      <NativeMenuItem Header="Edit">
        <NativeMenuItem.Menu>
          <NativeMenu>
            <NativeMenuItem Header="Copy"/>
            <NativeMenuItem Header="Paste"/>
          </NativeMenu>
        </NativeMenuItem.Menu>
      </NativeMenuItem>
    </NativeMenu>
  </NativeMenu.Menu>
```

As you can see, native menus support gestures just like a normal MenuItem would.

# Optional Managed File Dialogs
Some operating systems may not have their own File dialogs, or you may prefer to use Avalonia own file dialog for consistent UI.

![ManagedDialogs](/blog/2019-12-13-avalonia-0.9.0-release/managed-file-dialog.png)

You can configure Avalonia to use the managed dialog by adding to the appbuilder like so:

```csharp
AppBuilder.Configure<App>()
.UsePlatformDetect()
.UseManagedSystemDialogs();
```

If you wish the file dialog to be hosted inside your own window, where you control the chrome, colour scheme, title, icon, etc you can also use...

```csharp
.UseManagedSystemDialogs<AppBuilder, MyCustomWindowType>();
```

# ItemsRepeater
The ItemsRepeater control has been ported from UWP. This gives very high performance when displaying very long lists.

# New Grid and GridSplitter
Now that WPF has been opensourced we have directly ported Grid and Grid Splitter from those repositories. This means you can now expect 100% identical behavior of these fundamental controls.
In December last year, Microsoft announced that WPF would be open sourced. In the intervening months, the source code was published and we have been able to take advantage of this by porting `Grid` and `GridSplitter` from WPF. This means you can now expect 100% identical behavior between Avalonia and WPF of these fundamental controls

# Performance Improvements
It's worth mentioning that there have been many improvements to Avalonia especially to improve performance, reduce the amount of memory and improve speed. Many projects are now able to run smoothly on embedded platforms like Raspberry PI for instance.

# Production Ready
Many people come and ask, is Avalonia production ready? The answer is YES!
There are now several applications built on Avalonia with large user bases. We see all the time many commercial products that are now porting to Avalonia.

The teams behinds these projects have been involved with testing this release.

For this reason we will be maintaining a branch of the 0.9 release with only bug fixes. So 0.9 will be maintained and supported even as we start the development of the next major version of Avalonia.
 
 # Getting started

Follow instructions [here](/docs/quickstart).
