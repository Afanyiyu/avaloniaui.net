We are pleased to announce that [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) 0.10.0 has been
released.

0.10 is a huge update, it has been extensively tested and brings some great new features and improvements.

## Fluent Theme

The most noticable change for Avalonia 0.10 is a beautiful new Fluent theme. Now your Avalonia applications will look better than ever:

The fluent theme is available in light and dark modes, and will be used by the 0.10 templates by default. 

## New Controls

Along with the fluent theme, several new controls have been added:

### DatePicker/TimePicker

### ToggleSwitch

### Label

The `Label` control allows a text label with a shortcut key to be assocated with a control such as a `TextBox` such that pressing Alt plus the shortcut key will focus the associated control:

```xml
<StackPanel>
  <!-- Pressing Alt+N will focus nameTextBox -->
  <Label Target="nameTextBox">_Name</Label>
  <TextBox Name="nameTextBox">
</StackPanel>
```

The shortcut key is designated by prepending an underscore to the desired character in the `Label` content, `N` in this example.

## Compiled Bindings

Avalonia 0.10 includes experimental support for compiled bindings. When using compiled bindings, binding paths are verified at compile time and do not use reflection at runtime.

To enable compiled bindings, add an `x:DataType` attribute to your root control and use the `{CompiledBinding}` markup extension.

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml'
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication"
        xmlns:vm="using:AvaloniaApplication.ViewModels" 
        x:DataType="vm:MainWindowViewModel">
  <!-- The existence of the MyValue property will be checked at compile-time -->
  <TextBox Text="{CompiledBinding MyValue}"/>
</Window>
```

## Typed Property Change Notifications

The `OnPropertyChanged` method and `AvaloniaProperty<T>.Changed` observable APIs have been changed to use a typed `AvaloniaPropertyChangedEventArgs<T>` class to prevent boxing. Note that this is a [breaking change](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Breaking-Changes).

## SelectionModel

Selection on `SelectingItemsControl`-derived controls such as `ListBox` and `ComboBox` now implement their selection tracking via a `SelectionModel` which gives the following improvements:

- Selection ranges are now stored as a range of indexes, so selecting all items in a large list of for example 100,000 elements is now stored simply as a range of `0-99999`. Previously each selected item was added to a list, inflating memory usage
- Selection now handles duplicate items
- The selection model can be bound to a view model allowing fine control of the selected items at the view model layer
