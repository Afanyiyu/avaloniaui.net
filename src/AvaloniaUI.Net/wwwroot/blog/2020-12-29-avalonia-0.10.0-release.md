We are pleased to announce that [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) 0.10.0 has been
released.

0.10 is a huge update, it has been extensively tested and brings some great new features and improvements.

## Fluent Theme

The most noticable change for Avalonia 0.10 is a beautiful new Fluent theme. Now your Avalonia applications will look better than ever:

The fluent theme is available in light and dark modes, and will be used by the 0.10 templates by default. 

Along with the fluent theme, several new controls have been added including:

- `DatePicker`
- `TimePicker`
- `ToggleSwitch`

## Compiled Bindings

Avalonia 0.10 includes experimental support for compiled bindings. When using compiled bindings, binding paths are verified at compile time and do not use reflection at runtime.

To enable compiled bindings, add an `x:DataType` attribute to your root control and use the `{CompiledBinding}` markup extension.

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml'
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication"
        xmlns:vm="using:AvaloniaApplication.ViewModels" 
        x:DataType="vm:MainWindowViewModel">
  <!-- The existence of the MyValue property will be checked at compile-time -->
  <TextBox Text="{CompiledBinding MyValue}"/>
</Window>
```
